## Background ðŸ“š

This project was part of a university assignment focused on natural language processing. At first glance, it might look like a typical scraping job â€” and honestly, it kind of is ðŸ˜…. My main goal was to collect a clean set of Georgian language text from the Common Crawl dataset.

Turns out, scraping *Georgian* websites is an entirely different beast. I tried a ridiculous number of approaches to filter out non-Georgian content â€” regexes, language detection libraries, URL filtering... you name it. Unfortunately, none of them were truly effective. But hey, thatâ€™s the beauty of assignments, right? ðŸ˜„

While the filters used in this code arenâ€™t top-tier, they serve as a reference point for others who might want to attempt something similar. If you're exploring ways to build a Georgian language corpus, feel free to take a look, fork it, and make it better. Just donâ€™t expect miracles from this version ðŸ˜….

## Dataset ðŸ“¦

The resulting corpus is publicly available on Hugging Face:

It's not massive, and it's definitely not even close to perfect language corpus â€” but itâ€™s a starting point.
